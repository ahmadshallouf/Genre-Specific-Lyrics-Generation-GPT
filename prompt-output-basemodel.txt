The first two albums of the "Arctic Monkeys" EP are "Bigger. Better. More." and "The Heart of the Mountain".

The third and final album "Living," is a reexamination of what makes the band's sound so unique. During an interview last year, guitarist and longtime producer Oskar Lindvold was asked if he had ever heard the band's music before. "I'm not sure," he replied bluntly. Some of his longtime colleagues at WildCat are now calling it "quite a creative exercise . . . even when the music's pretty good. It's not good musical. But it's good, and it's awesome. The only thing I don't like about it is that I remember it so much, and it's terrible. But then I remembered my dad growing up singing it and I thought, 'Wow, he's singing it like that. Such a genius. We need to do an album with one of those. But we have to do it as a band.'"

Lindvold's longtime collaborator and drummer, Dave Miller, says those same creative challenges came to him during the writing process of the record when the band had a project under their belt. "I remember working with Oskar after [Stalwart's] 'Just Give Me Something,' which was the bass line from "The Wind Up." It was really surreal, to shoot a video of him playing guitar, and he was like, 'Oh, I can't even put it into my head.' I was like, 'Wow, I can't do this!' And then he said, 'No!'"

Miller recalls the inspiration for how well Miller went about explaining to the guys that he loves the band's music and that he was inspired by the likes of Rammstein,
